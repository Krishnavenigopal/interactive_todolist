# interactive_todolist
This is an interactive todolist application developed using React JS and styled using tailwind CSS. 

  There is an option to edit the Todos, delete the todos in the list
  Also if the todo is done, there is a checkbox to mark it as done.
  Once the todo is done, the name of the todo entry will be striked off.
  When you have atleast one todo, there appears a toggle btn group to list todos which are in pending or in completed state or all todos.
